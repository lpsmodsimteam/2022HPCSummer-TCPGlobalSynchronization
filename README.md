# Demonstration of Global Synchronization in SST 

[Structural Simulation Toolkit](https://sst-simulator.org/) (SST) is a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) framework written in C++ and Python. Although SST has historically focused on simulation of High Performance Computing, the DES framework can be used in other scenarios. 

In this repo, [global synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_global_synchronization) is modeled using SST. 


This demonstration of global synchronization relies only on [SST-Core](https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-core)


# Objectives
- [x] literature search for instances of this problem
- [x] identify underlying mathematical or logical conditions that trigger this problem in distributed systems
- [x] identify minimum features for C++ components needed to create this problem
- [x] identify minimum size of graph (links, components) to observe the issue
- [x] identify metrics needed to identify the existence of the problem
- [x] measure the metrics and demonstrate the detection of the problem
- [x] use the metrics to identify the problem at various scales (e.g., 10 nodes, 100 nodes, 1000 nodes)

# Context

The intended audience for this documentation has basic familiar with use of SST, C++, Python, Makefiles.

Documentation should explain how the concept of Congestive Collapse is mapped to the SST model.
